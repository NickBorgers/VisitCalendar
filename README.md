# Visit Calendar Tool

## Description
This project uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to [publish some HTML and CSS to render calendar events](https://visit.nickborgers.com) described in JavaScript. Minimal personal information is exposed to preserve privacy.


## Directions
Modfy [data.js](data.js) as indicated in the comments in that file to add additional events. If the data input is invalid deployment will fail and you should be notified you made a bad change.
