# Visit Calendar Tool

## Description
This project publishes some HTML and CSS to GitHub pages to render calendar events described in JavaScript. Minimal personal information is exposed to preserve privacy.


## Directions
Modfy [data.js](data.js) as indicated in the comments in that file to add additional events. If the data input is invalid deployment will fail and you should be notified you made a bad change.
